## WDI Project 3: Love Scene

[Love Scene](http://lovescene.herokuapp.com/) was created by Michael Ray, Ed Petil, and Katie Ouaknine

### Objective:
[Love Scene](http://lovescene.herokuapp.com/) is an online dating platform for people who like to stream movies and television shows. Instead of using complicated algorythyms to find a mate, we simplified the search by using a single yet sometimes very fortelling criteria. Users can create a dating profile and then search for tv shows and movies they like or would be interested in seeing. Those tv/movie choices are added to their personal profile where other users can search and then compare interests. Need a movie buddy or a date? Love Scene can help you find a mate!

### Installation Instructions
